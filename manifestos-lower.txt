this chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. i know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of united states politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. blasphemy is not apostasy. irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. irony is about humour and serious play. it is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one i would like to see more honoured within socialist-feminism. at the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg. 
 
a cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. the international women’s movements have constructed “women’s experience,” as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. this experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. the cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women’s experience in the late twentieth century. this is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. 
 
contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs -- creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. {150}  modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. cyborg “sex” restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of taylorism seem idyllic. and modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by c3i, command-control-communication intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984’s us defence budget. i am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. michael foucault’s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field. 
 
by the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. the cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. the cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. in the traditions of ”western” science and politics -- the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other -- the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. the stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. this chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. it is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. the cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. as zoe sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on jacques lacan, melanie klein, and nuclear culture, the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival. 
 
the cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. in a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the western sense -- a “final” irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the {151} ”west’s” escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. an origin story in the ”western,” humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and marxism. hilary klein has argued that both marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. the cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the western sense. this is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars. 
 
the cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. it is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. no longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. the relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. unlike the hopes of frankenstein’s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. the cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. the cyborg would not recognize the garden of eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. perhaps that is why i want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the enemy. cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. they are wary of holism, but needy for connection -- they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. the main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. but illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. their fathers, after all, are inessential. 
 
i will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter, but now i want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible. by the late twentieth century in united states scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. the last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks -- language tool {152} use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. and many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. biology and evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science. within this framework, teaching modern christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse. 
 
biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. there is much room for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary. the cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. far from signalling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange. 
 
the second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. this dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. but basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. they could not achieve man’s dream, only mock it. they were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. to think they were otherwise was paranoid. now we are not so sure. late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. 
 
technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world. “textualization” of everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived relations of domination that ground the “play” of arbitrary reading. it is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). in short, the certainty of what counts as nature -- a {153} source of insight and promise of innocence -- is undermined, probably fatally. the transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology grounding “western” epistemology. but the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism destroying “man” by the “machine” or “meaningful political action” by the “text.” who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. both chimpanzees and artifacts have politics, so why shouldn’t we? 
 
the third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. pop physics books on the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to harlequin romances as a marker of radical change in american white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the father’s ubiquity and spirituality. the silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. writing, power, and technology are old partners in western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. miniaturization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. contrast the tv sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the tv wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile -- a matter of immense human pain in detroit and singapore. people are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. cyborgs are ether, quintessence. 
 
the ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt machines are so deadly. they are as hard to see politically as materially. they are about consciousness -- or its simulation. they are floating signifiers moving in pickup trucks across europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings of the displaced and so unnatural “greenham women,” who read the cyborg webs of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. ultimately the “hardest” science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, c3i, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. the new machines are so clean and light. their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution {154} associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. the diseases evoked by these clean machines are “no more” than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, “no more” than the experience of stress. the nimble fingers of “oriental” women, the old fascination of little anglo-saxon victorian girls with doll’s houses, women’s enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. there might be a cyborg alice [of wonderland] taking account of these new dimensions. ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in asia and spiral dancing in santa rita jail whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies. 
 
so my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. one of my premises is that most american socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artefacts associated with “high technology” and scientific culture. from one-dimensional man (marcuse, 1964) to the death of nature (merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. but a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies. 
 
from one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a star wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women’s bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (sofia, 1984). from another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. the political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters. cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. i like to imagine lag, the livermore action group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools {155} of technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form that actually manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, christians, mothers, and leninists long enough to disarm the state. “fission impossible” is the name of the affinity group in my town. (affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidity.)

abstraction, virtuality and complexity are part of daily life. xenofeminism constructs a worldview adapted to these realities: a theory of practical cunning, scale, and vision; a future in which the realization of emancipation contributes to a universalist politics assembled from the needs of all.

no more futureless repetition on the treadmill of capital, no more submission to the drudgery of labour. xf seizes alienation as an opportunity to generate new worlds. we are always already alienated. it is through, and not despite, alienation that we can liberate ourselves from immediacy. freedom and parity are neither a given nor natural and their construction entails more not less alienation. alienation is the labor of their construction. nothing should be accepted as fixed and permanent—neither material conditions and social forms, nor the technological horizon. the glorification of ‘nature’ has nothing to offer. xf is anti-naturalist because naturalism stinks of humanism and theology.

 in regards to feminism, xf seeks to eventually eliminate the need for such theory and its hegemonic deployment.

xf promotes the idea of using existing and emerging technologies to re-engineer the world. there should be no doubt that technology is fraught with serious risks; it is prone to imbalance, abuse, and exploitation. rather than pretending to risk nothing, we ought to augment political interfaces between technologies in accordance with these risks. technology is neither inherently progressive nor intrinsically regressive; it functions influx with culture in positive and negative feedback loops that make linear sequencing, prediction, and total caution impossible. the real emancipatory potential of technology remains unrealized. fed by the market, its rapid growth is offset by bloat, and its elegant innovation packaged for consumers whose stagnant world it decorates with updates and upgrades. gender, racial, class and geographical disparities still characterize the fields in which our technologies are conceived, built, and legislated.

xenofeminism is rationalism par excellence. to claim that reason or rationality is "by nature" white, patriarchal and european is to simply concede defeat. yes, it is true that the canonical “history of thought” is dominated by men, and it is male hands we see throttling existing institutions of science, politics and art. but this is precisely because of this miserable imbalance, and not despite it that opposing the dominance of white heterosexual european-descent man must be itself rational. science ought to ultimately be redefined as the only true suspension of inequality. if today it is dominated by masculine egos, then it is at odds with its own true function. reason seeks the kinds of parity and freedom, which eurocentric patriarchy cannot provide.

xf is genderless, sexless and inhuman, unbound by physical, biological, natural and historical limitations. xf is a space for marking the intersection of these claims visible. it names reason and reason alone as the engine of emancipation, and the right of everyone to speak as no one in particular.

the excess of modesty in emancipatory movements is not proportionate to the world’s monstrous geopolitical, cultural and scientific complexities. systematic thinking and structural analysis have largely fallen by the wayside in favor of admirable, but insufficient struggles, bound to arbitrary identities, fixed localities and fragmented insurrections. while capitalism is understood as a complex and ever-expanding totality, most anti-capitalist projects remain profoundly fearful of transitioning to the universal, resisting big-picture speculative politics by condemning them as suspicious vectors. such a false guarantee treats universals as absolute, generating a debilitating disjuncture between what we seek to depose and the strategies required for reaching this objective.

global complexity opens us to promethean cognitive and political demands. much of twenty-first century politics—from the remnants of post-war western marxism to postmodern countercultural movements— fail to address these challenges in a manner capable of producing substantial and enduring change. xenofeminism encounters these obligations as a collectivity capable of transitioning between multiple levels of political, material and conceptual organization.

xenofeminism is synthetic, unsatisfied by analysis alone. it urges constructive oscillation between description and prescription to mobilize the recursive potential of contemporary technologies upon disparities of power. given that there are a range of challenges specifically relating to life in the digital age, the situation requires a philosophy at ease with computation. however, xenofeminism is about more than digital self-defence, cyber equality and freedom from oppressive networks. we assert the exercise of positive freedom--freedom-to rather than simply freedom-from--and demand the invention of novel cognitive and material technologies in the service of the common ends.

the radical opportunities afforded by new forms of technological mediation should no longer serve the interests of capital, which, by design, benefits the few. the constantly proliferating fruits of technology can be annexed, and although no one can claim their total accessibility, digital tools have never been more widely available or more sensitive to appropriation than they are today. this is not an intentional omission of the fact that a large amount of the world's poor is adversely affected by the expanding technological industry. multinational corporations’ employees work the developing world under abominable conditions while entire towns are becoming a repository for the world's electronic waste. xf acknowledges these conditions as a target for elimination. just as the invention of the stock market was also the harbinger of the economic crash, xf understands that technological innovation must responsively anticipate its own systemic failures.


be a full person. motherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood. be a full person. your child will benefit from that. the pioneering american journalist marlene sanders once said to a younger journalist, “never apologize for working. you love what you do, and loving what you do is a great gift to give your child.”
you don’t even have to love your job; you can merely love what your job does for you – the confidence and self-fulfillment that come with doing and earning. reject the idea of motherhood and work as mutually exclusive. our mothers worked full time while we were growing up, and we turned out well – at least you did, the jury is still out on me.
it doesn’t surprise me that your sister-in-law says you should be a ‘traditional’ mother and stay home, that chudi can afford not to have a ‘double income’ family. 
people will selectively use ‘tradition’ to justify anything. tell her that a double-income family is actually the true igbo tradition because in pre-colonial times, mothers farmed and traded. and then please ignore her; there are more important things to think about.
in these coming weeks of early motherhood, be kind to yourself. ask for help. expect to be helped. there is no such thing as a superwoman. parenting is about practice – and love. (i do wish though that ‘parent’ had not been turned into a verb, which i think is the root of the middle-class phenomenon of ‘parenting’ as one endless, anxious journey of guilt).
give yourself room to fail. a new mother does not necessarily know how to calm a crying baby. don’t assume that you should know everything. look things up on the internet, read books, ask older parents, or just do trial and error. let your focus be on remaining a full person. take time for yourself. nurture your own needs.
please do not think of it as ‘doing it all.’ our culture lauds the idea of women who are able to ‘do it all’ but does not question the premise of that praise. i have no interest in the debate about women ‘doing it all’ because it is a debate that assumes that care-giving and domestic work are exclusively female domains, an idea that i strongly reject. domestic work and care-giving should be gender-neutral, and we should be asking not whether a woman can ‘do it all’ but how best to support parents in their dual duties at work and at home.
do it together. remember in primary school we learnt that a verb was a ‘doing’ word? well, a father is as much a verb as a mother. chudi should do everything that biology allows – which is everything but breastfeeding. sometimes mothers, so conditioned to be all and do all, are complicit in diminishing the role of fathers. you might think that chudi will not bathe her exactly as you’d like, that he might not wipe her bum as perfectly as you do. but so what? what is the worst that can happen? she won’t die at the hands of her father. so look away, arrest your perfectionism, still your socially-conditioned sense of duty. share childcare equally. ‘equally’ of course depends on you both. it does not have to mean a literal fifty-fifty or a day-by-day score-keeping but you’ll know when the child-care work is equally shared. you’ll know by your lack of resentment. because when there is true equality, resentment does not exist.
and please reject the language of help. chudi is not ‘helping’ you by caring for his child. he is doing what he should. when we say fathers are ‘helping,’ we are suggesting that childcare is a mother’s territory, into which fathers valiantly venture. it is not. can you imagine how many more people today would be happier, more stable, better contributors to the world, if only their fathers had been actively present in their childhood? and never say that chudi is ‘babysitting’ – people who babysit are people for whom the baby is not a primary responsibility.
chudi does not deserve any special gratitude or praise, nor do you – you both made the choice to bring a child into the world, and the responsibility for that child belongs equally to you both. it would be different if you were a single mother, whether by circumstance or choice, because ‘doing it together’ would then not be an option. but you should not be a ‘single mother’ unless you are truly a single mother.
my friend nwabu once told me that, because his wife left when his kids were young, he became ‘mr. mom,’ by which he meant that he did the daily care-giving. but he was not being a ‘mr. mom,’ he was simply being a dad.
teach her that ‘gender roles’ is absolute nonsense. do not ever tell her that she should do or not do something “because you are a girl.”
‘because you are a girl’ is never a reason for anything. ever.
i remember being told as a child to ‘bend down properly while sweeping, like a girl.’ which meant that sweeping was about being female. i wish i had been told simply ‘bend down and sweep properly because you’ll clean the floor better.’ and i wish my brothers had been told the same thing.
there have been recent nigerian social media debates about women and cooking, about how wives have to cook for husbands. it is funny, in the way that sad things are funny, that in 2016 we are still talking about cooking as some kind of ‘marriageability test’ for women.
the knowledge of cooking does not come pre-installed in a vagina. cooking is learned. cooking – domestic work in general – is a life skill that both men and women should ideally have. it is also a skill that can elude both men and women.
we also need to question the idea of marriage as a prize to women, because that is the basis of these absurd debates. if we stop conditioning women to see marriage as a prize, then we would have fewer debates about a wife needing to cook in order to earn that prize.
it is interesting to me how early the world starts to invent gender roles. yesterday i went to a children’s shop to buy chizalum an outfit. in the girls’ section were pale phenomena in washed-out shades of pink. i disliked them. the boys’ section had outfits in vibrant shades of blue. because i think blue will be adorable against her brown skin – and photograph better – i bought one. at the check out counter, the cashier said mine was the perfect present for the new boy. i said it was for a baby girl. she looked horrified. “blue for a girl?”
i cannot help but wonder about the clever marketing person who invented this pink-blue binary. there was also a ‘gender neutral’ section, with its array of bloodless grays. ‘gender neutral’ is silly because it is premised on the idea of male being blue and female being pink and ‘gender neutral’ being its own category. why not just have baby clothes organized by age and displayed in all colors? the bodies of male and female infants are similar, after all.
i looked at the toy section, also arranged by gender. toys for boys are mostly active, and involve some sort of ‘doing’ – trains, cars – and toys for girls are mostly ‘passive’ and are overwhelmingly dolls. i was struck by how early our culture starts to form the ideas of what a boy should be and what a girl should be.
did i ever tell you about going to a us mall with a seven-year-old nigerian girl and her mother? she saw a toy helicopter, one of those things that fly by wireless remote control, and she was fascinated and asked for one. “no,” her mother said. “you have your dolls.” and she responded, “mummy, is it only doll i will play with?”
i have never forgotten that. her mother meant well, obviously. she was well-versed in the ideas of gender roles – that girls play with dolls and boys with cars. i wonder now, wistfully, if the little girl would have turned out to be a revolutionary engineer, had she been given a chance to explore that helicopter.
if we don’t place the straitjacket of gender roles on young children we give them space to reach their full potential. please see chizalum as an individual. not as a girl who should be a certain way. see her weaknesses and her strengths in an individual way. do not measure her on a scale of what a girl should be. measure her on a scale of being the best version of herself.
a young woman once told me that she had for years behaved ‘like a boy’ – she liked football and was bored by dresses – until her mother forced her to stop her ‘boyish’ interests and she is now grateful to her mother for helping her start behaving like a girl. the story made me sad. i wondered what parts of herself she had needed to silence and stifle, and i wondered about what her spirit had lost, because what she called ‘behaving like a boy’ was simply that she was behaving like herself.
another acquaintance once told me that when she took her one-year-old son to a baby play group, where babies had been brought by their mothers, she noticed that the mothers of baby girls were very restraining, constantly telling the girls ‘don’t touch’ or ‘stop and be nice,’ and she noticed that the baby boys were encouraged to explore more and were not restrained as much and were almost never told to ‘be nice.’ her theory is that parents unconsciously start very early to teach girls how to be, that baby girls are given more rules and less room and baby boys more room and fewer rules.
gender roles are so deeply conditioned in us that we will often follow them even when they chafe against our true desires, our needs, our wellbeing. they are very difficult to unlearn, and so it is important to try and make sure that chizalum rejects them from the beginning. instead of gender roles, teach her self-reliance. tell her that it is important to be able to do for herself and fend for herself. teach her to try and fix physical things when they break. we are quick to assume girls can’t do many things. let her try. buy her toys like blocks and trains – and dolls, too, if you want to.
beware the danger of what i call feminism lite. it is the idea of conditional female equality. reject this entirely. it is a hollow, appeasing, and bankrupt idea. being a feminist is like being pregnant. you either are or you are not. you either believe in the full equality of women, or you do not.
here are some examples of feminism lite:
a woman should be ambitious, but not too much. a woman can be successful but she should also do her domestic duties and cook for her husband. a woman should have her own but she should not forget her true role as home keeper. of course a woman should have a job but the man is still head of the family.
feminism lite uses inane analogies like ‘he is the head and you are the neck.’ or ‘he is driving but you are in the front seat.’ more troubling is the idea, in feminism lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to ‘treat women well.’ no. no. no. there must be more than male benevolence as the basis for a woman’s wellbeing.
feminism lite uses the language of ‘allowing.’ theresa may is the british prime minister and here is how a progressive british newspaper described her husband: ‘philip may is known in politics as a man who has taken a back seat and allowed his wife, theresa, to shine.’ 
allowed.
now let us reverse it. theresa may has allowed her husband to shine. does it make sense? if philip may were prime minister, perhaps we might hear that his wife has ‘supported’ him from the background, or that she is ‘behind’ him, but we would never hear that she had ‘allowed’ him to shine.
allow is a troubling word. allow is about power. members of the society of feminism lite will often say, “leave the woman alone to do what she wants as long as her husband allows.”
a husband is not a headmaster. a wife is not a schoolgirl. permission and being allowed, when used one sided – and it is nearly only used that way – should never be the language of an equal marriage.
another egregious example of feminism lite: men who say ‘of course a wife does not always have to do the domestic work, i did domestic work when my wife travelled.’
do you remember how we laughed and laughed at an atrociously-written piece about me some years ago? the writer – a man small in more ways than one – had accused me of being ‘angry,’ as though ‘being angry’ was something for which to be ashamed. of course i am angry. i am angry about racism. i am angry about sexism. but i am angrier about sexism than i am about racism. because i live among many people who easily acknowledge race injustice but not gender injustice.
i cannot tell you how often people i care about – men and women – have expected me to make a case for sexism, to ‘prove’ it, as it were, while never having the same expectation for racism (obviously in the wider world, too many people are still expected to ‘prove’ racism, but not in my close circle). i cannot tell you how often people i care about have dismissed or diminished sexist situations.
like ikenga who once said ‘even though the general idea is that my father is in charge at our home, it’s my mother who is really in charge behind the scenes.’ he thought he was refuting sexism, but he was making my case. why ‘behind the scenes?’ if a woman has power then why do we need to disguise that she has power?
but here is a sad truth – our world is full of men and women who do not like powerful women. we have been so conditioned to think of power as male, that a powerful woman is an aberration. and so she is policed. we ask of powerful women – is she humble? does she smile? is she grateful enough? does she have a domestic side? we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. and feminism lite enables this.
teach chizalum to read. teach her to love books. the best way is by casual example. if she sees you reading, she will understand that reading is valuable. if she were not to go to school, and merely just read books, she would arguably become more knowledgeable than a conventionally educated child. books will help her understand and question the world, help her express herself, and help her in whatever she wants to become – a chef, a scientist, a singer all benefit from the skills that reading brings. i do not mean school books. i mean books that have nothing to do with school, autobiographies and novels and histories. if all else fails, pay her to read. reward her. i know of this incredible nigerian woman who was raising her child in the us; her child did not take to reading so she decided to pay her 5 cents per page. an expensive endeavor, she later joked, but a worthy investment.
teach her to question language. language is the repository of our prejudices, our beliefs, our assumptions. but to teach her that, you will have to question your own language. a friend of mine says she will never call her daughter ‘princess.’ people mean well when they say this, but ‘princess’ is loaded with assumptions, of her delicacy, of the prince who will come to save her, etc. this friend prefers ‘angel’ and ‘star.’
so decide for yourself the things you will not say to your child. because what you say to your child matters. it teaches her what she should value. you know that igbo joke, used to tease girls who are being childish – “what are you doing? don’t you know you are old enough to find a husband?” i used to say that often. but now i choose not to. i say ‘you are old enough to find a job.’ because i do not believe that marriage is something we should teach young girls to aspire to.
i no longer say ‘she had a child for him.’ i say ‘she had a child with him.’ and i bristle when i hear a man say ‘she is carrying my child.’ ‘our child’ just sounds better, more accurate too.
try not to use words like ‘misogyny’ and ‘patriarchy’ too often with chizalum. we feminists can sometimes be too jargony, and jargon can sometimes feel too abstract. don’t just label something misogynistic, tell her why it is, and tell her what would make it not be.
use examples. teach her that if you criticize x in women but do not criticize x in men, then you do not have a problem with x, you have a problem with women. for x please insert inter alia: anger, loudness, stubbornness, coldness, ruthlessness.
teach her to ask questions like: what are the things that women cannot do because they are women? do these things have cultural prestige? if so why are only men allowed to do the things that have cultural prestige?
use examples from the news. two nigerian senators quarrel publicly. the woman calls the man a bastard, and the man tells the woman that he will rape her. the man is sexist because he has not insulted her as an individual, but as a generic female and this is dehumanizing. he should have called her a bastard too. or an asshole. or so many other things that are not about her being a generic woman.
remember that television commercial we watched in lagos, where a man cooks and his wife claps for him? true progress is when she doesn’t clap for him but just reacts to the food itself - she can either praise the food or not praise the food, just as he can praise hers or not praise hers, but what is sexist is that she is praising the fact that he has undertaken the act of cooking, praise that implies that cooking is an inherently female act.
remember the mechanic in lagos who was described as a ‘lady mechanic?’ teach chizalum that the woman is a mechanic not a ‘lady mechanic.’
point out to her how wrong it is that a man who hits your car, gets out and tells you to go and bring your husband because he can't "deal with a woman".
instead of merely telling her, show her with examples that misogyny can be overt and misogyny can be subtle and that both are abhorrent.
teach her to question men who can have empathy for women only if they see them as relational rather than as individual equal humans. men who, when discussing rape, will always say something like ‘if it were my daughter or wife or sister.’ yet such men do not need to imagine a male victim of crime ‘as a brother or son’ in order to feel empathy. teach her, too, to question the idea of women as a special species. the american house speaker paul ryan who was recently reacting to the republican presidential nominee’s boast about assaulting women, said, “women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.”
tell chizalum that women actually don’t need to be championed and revered; they just need to be treated as equal human beings. there is a patronizing undertone to the idea of women needing to be ‘championed and revered’ because they are women. it makes me think of chivalry, and the premise of chivalry is female weakness.
never speak of marriage as an achievement. find ways to make clear to her that marriage is not an achievement nor is it what she should aspire to. a marriage can be happy or unhappy but it is not an achievement.
we condition girls to aspire to marriage and we do not condition boys to aspire to marriage, and so there is already a terrible imbalance at the start. the girls will grow up to be women obsessed with marriage. the boys will grow up to be men who are not obsessed with marriage. the women marry those men. the relationship is automatically uneven because the institution matters more to one than the other. is it any wonder that, in so many marriages, women sacrifice more, at a loss to themselves, because they have to constantly maintain an uneven exchange? (one consequence of this imbalance is the very shabby and very familiar phenomenon of two women publicly fighting over a man, while the man remains silent.)
hillary clinton will be the next president of the united states. on her twitter account, the first descriptor is ‘wife.’ the first descriptor on her husband bill clinton’s twitter account is not ‘husband.’ (because of this, i have an unreasonable respect for the very few men who use ‘husband’ as their first descriptor)
my sense is that this is not a reflection on hillary clinton personally but on the world in which we live, a world that still largely values a woman’s marital and maternal roles more than anything else.
after she married bill clinton in 1975, hillary clinton kept her name, hillary rodham. eventually she began to add his name ‘clinton’ to hers and then after a while she dropped ‘rodham’ because of political pressure – because her husband would lose voters who were offended that his wife had kept her name. american voters apparently place retrograde marital expectations on women.
do you remember all the noise that was made after a newspaper journalist decided to give me a new name and call ‘mrs. husband’s surname’ and i promptly told him never to do that again?
i remember how some members of the society of ill-willed nigerian commenters insisted on calling me mrs. husband’s name even after i had made clear that it was not my name. many more women than men did this, by the way. and there was a smoldering hostility from women in particular. i wondered about that, and thought that perhaps for many of them, my choice represented a challenge to their largely-unquestioned idea of what is the norm. even some friends made statements like ‘you are successful and so it is okay to keep your name.’ 
which made me wonder – why does a woman have to be successful at work in order to justify keeping her name?
the truth is that i have not kept my name because i am successful. had i not had the good fortune to be published and widely-read, i would still have kept my name. i have kept my name because it is my name. i have kept my name because i like my name.
there are people who say – well your name is also about patriarchy because it is your father’s name. indeed. but the point is simply this: whether it came from my father or from the moon, it is the name that i have had since i was born, the name with which i travelled my life’s milestones, the name i have answered to since that first day i went to kindergarten on a hazy morning and my teacher said ‘answer ‘present’ if you hear your name. number one: adichie!’
i like it and will not change it. more importantly, every woman should have that choice. how many men do you think would be willing to change their name on getting married?
as for titles, i dislike the title of ‘mrs.’ because i think nigerian society gives it too much value – i have observed too many cases of men and women who loudly and proudly speak of the title of mrs. as though those who are not mrs have somehow failed at something. mrs can be a choice, but to infuse it with so much value as our culture does is disturbing. the value we give to mrs. means that marriage changes the social status of a woman but not of a man. (is that perhaps why many women complain of married men still ‘acting’ as though they were single? perhaps if our society asked married men to change their names and take on a new title, different from mr, their behavior might change as well? ha!) but more seriously, if you, a 28-year-old masters degree holder, go overnight from ijeawele ude to mrs. ijeawele onyekailodibe, surely it requires not just the mental energy of changing passports and licenses but also a psychic change, a new ‘becoming?’ this new ‘becoming’ would not matter so much if men, too, had to undergo it.
still on titles, i like ms because it is similar to mr. a man is mr whether married or not, a woman is ms whether married or not. so please teach chizalum that in a truly just society, women should not be expected to make marriage-based changes that men are not expected to make. here’s a nifty solution – each couple that marries should take on an entirely new surname, chosen however they want to as long as both agree to it, so that a day after the wedding, both husband and wife can hold hands and joyfully journey off to the municipal offices to change their passports, drivers licenses, signatures, initials, bank accounts, etc.
teach her to reject likeability. her job is not to make herself likeable, her job is to be her full self, a self that is honest and aware of the equal humanity of other people. remember i told you how infuriating it was to me that chioma would often tell me that ‘people’ would not ‘like’ something i wanted to say or do. it upset me because i felt, from her, the unspoken pressure to change myself to fit some mold that would please an amorphous entity called ‘people.’ it was upsetting because we want those close to us to encourage us to be our most authentic selves.
please do not ever put this pressure on your daughter. we teach girls to be likeable, to be nice, to be false. and we do not teach boys the same. this is dangerous. many sexual predators have capitalized on this. many girls remain silent when abused because they want to be nice. many girls spend too much time trying to be ‘nice’ to people who do them harm. many girls think of the ‘feelings’ of those who are hurting them. this is the catastrophic consequence of likeability. at a recent rape trial, the woman raped by a man said that she did not want to ‘cause conflict.’ we have a world full of women who are unable fully to exhale because they have for so long been conditioned to fold themselves into shapes to make themselves likeable.
so instead of teaching chizalum to be likeable, teach her to be honest. and kind.
and brave. encourage her to speak her mind, to say what she really thinks, to speak truthfully. and then praise her when she does. praise her especially when she takes a stand that is difficult or unpopular because it happens to be her honest position. tell her that kindness matters. praise her when she is kind to other people. but teach her that her kindness must never be taken for granted. tell her that she too deserves the kindness of others. teach her to stand for what is hers. if another child takes her toy without her permission, ask her to take it back. tell her that if anything ever makes her uncomfortable, to speak up, to say, to shout.
show her that she does not need to be liked by everyone. tell her that if someone does not like her, there will be someone who will. teach her that she is not merely an object to be liked or disliked, she is also a subject who can like or dislike. in her teenage years, if she comes home crying about some boys who don’t like her, let her know she can also choose not to like those boys.
here’s this bit from the new york times, about a security agent who was there on the night that gunshots were fired at the white house.
<<officer carrie johnson, who had heard debris fall from the truman balcony the night before, listened during the roll call before her shift saturday afternoon as supervisors explained that the gunshots were from people in two cars shooting at each other. johnson had told several senior officers friday night that she thought the house had been hit. but on saturday she did not challenge her superiors, “for fear of being criticized,” she later told investigators.>>
this fear of being criticized is a consequence of likeability. a man is much less likely to give that as a reason, simply because men are much less likely to be raised with likeability as a central life motif.
give chizalum a sense of identity. it matters. be deliberate about it. let her grow up to think of herself as, among other things, a proud igbo woman. and you must be selective – teach her to embrace the parts of igbo culture that are beautiful and teach her to reject the parts that are not. you can say to her, in different contexts and different ways - “igbo culture is lovely because it values community and consensus and hard work, and the language and proverbs are beautiful and full of great wisdom. but igbo culture also teaches that a woman cannot do certain things just because she’s a woman and that is wrong. igbo culture also focuses a little too much on materialism and while money is important – because money means self-reliance – you must not give value to people based on who has money and who does not.”
be deliberate also about showing her the enduring beauty and resilience of africans and of black people. why? because of the power dynamics in the world, she will grow up seeing images of white beauty, white ability, and white achievement, no matter where she is in the world. it will be in the tv shows she watches, in the popular culture she consumes, in the books she reads. she will also probably grow up seeing many negative images of blackness and of africans.
teach her to take pride in the history of africans, and in the black diaspora. find black heroes, men and women, in history. they exist. you will have to counter some of the things she will learn in school – the nigerian curriculum isn’t quite infused with the idea of teaching children to have a sense of pride. western nations do it well, because they do it subtly, and they might even disagree about having it called ‘teaching pride’ but that is what it is. so her teachers will be fantastic at teaching her mathematics and science and art and music, but you will have to do the pride-teaching yourself.
teach her about privilege and inequality and the importance of giving dignity to everyone who does not mean her harm – teach her that the househelp is human just like her, teach her always to greet the driver and all domestic staff who are older than she is. link these expectations to her identity – for example, say to her “in our family, when you are a child, you greet those older than you no matter what job they do.”
give her an igbo nickname. when i was growing up, my aunty gladys called me ada obodo dike. i always loved that. apparently my village ezi-abba is known as the land of warriors and to be called daughter of the land of warriors was deliciously heady.
teach her to speak igbo. not as a project. too many igbo-speaking parents today approach this as though it were a project – they reward the children for speaking the rare sentence, enroll them in patchily-organized once-a-week igbo school and never actually make normal conversation with them in igbo. children are intelligent, they can easily sniff out what you value and what you don’t. once-a-week ventures into some class while not expecting them to actually speak igbo at home will make it very clear to them that you have little value for igbo. and it won’t work.
if chizalum is igbo-speaking, it will help her better navigate our globalized world. and studies have shown over and over that there are many benefits to being bilingual.
be deliberate about how you engage with her and her appearance.
encourage her participation in sports. teach her to be physically active. take walks with her. swim. run. play tennis. football. table tennis. all kinds of sports. any kind of sports. i think this is important not only because of the obvious health benefits but because it can help with all the body-image insecurities that the world thrusts on girls. let chizalum know that there is great value in being active. studies show that girls generally stop playing sports as puberty arrives. not surprising. breasts and self-consciousness can get in the way of sports. try not to let that get in her way.
if she likes makeup let her wear it. if she likes fashion let her dress up. but if she doesn’t like either let her be. don’t think that raising her feminist means forcing her to reject femininity. feminism and femininity are not mutually exclusive. it is misogynistic to suggest that they are. sadly, women have learned to be ashamed and apologetic about pursuits that are seen as traditionally female, such as fashion and makeup. but our society does not expect men to feel ashamed of pursuits considered generally male – sports cars, certain professional sports. in the same way, men’s grooming is never suspect in the way women’s grooming is – a well-dressed man does not worry that, because he is dressed well, certain assumptions might be made about his intelligence, his ability or his seriousness.
never ever link her appearance with morality. never tell her that a short skirt is ‘immoral.’ make dressing a question of taste and attractiveness instead of a question of morality. if you both clash over what she wants to wear, never say things like ‘you look like a prostitute’ as i know your mother once told you. instead say ‘ that dress doesn’t flatter you like this other one. or doesn’t fit as well. or doesn’t look as attractive. or is simply ugly. but never ‘immoral.’ because clothes have absolutely nothing to do with morality.
try not to link hair with pain. i think of my childhood and how often i cried while my dense long hair was being plaited. i think of how a packet of smarties chocolates was kept in front of me, as a reward if i sat through having my hair done. and for what? imagine if we had not spent so many saturdays of our childhood and teenagehood doing our hair. what might we have learned? in what ways might we have grown? what did boys do on saturdays?
so with her hair, i suggest that you redefine ‘neat.’ part of the reason that hair is about pain for so many girls is that adults are determined to conform to a version of ‘neat’ that means too tight and scalp-destroying and headache-infusing.
we need to stop. i’ve seen girls in school in nigeria being terribly harassed for their hair not being ‘neat,’ merely because some of their god-given hair had curled up in glorious tight little balls at their temples. make chizalum’s hair loose. and make that your definition of neat. go to her school and talk to the administration if you have to. it takes one person to make change happen. also, her hair doesn’t have to ‘last’ – another reason we give for painful hairstyles. i suggest that you make loose plaits and big cornrows and don’t use a tiny-teethed comb that wasn’t made with our hair texture in mind.
chizalum will notice very early on – because children are perceptive – what kind of beauty the mainstream world values. she will see it in magazines and films and television. she will see that whiteness is valued. she will notice that the hair texture that is valued is straight or swingy, and is hair that falls down rather than stands up. she will encounter these whether you like it or not. so make sure that you create alternatives for her to see. let her know that slim white women are beautiful, and that non-slim, non-white women are beautiful. let her know that there are many individuals and many cultures that do not find the narrow mainstream definition of beauty attractive. you will know your child best, and so you will know best how to affirm her own kind of beauty, how to protect her from looking at her own reflection with dissatisfaction.
surround her with a village of aunties, women who have qualities you’d like her to admire. talk about how much you admire them. children copy and learn from example. talk about what you admire about them. i, for example, particularly admire the african american feminist florynce kennedy. some african women that i would tell her about are ama ata aidoo, dora akunyili, muthoni likimani, ngozi okonjo iweala, taiwo ajayi lycett. there are so many african women who are sources of feminist inspiration. because of what they have done and because of what they have refused to do.
like your grandmother, by the way, that remarkable, strong, sharp-tongued babe. i remember once hearing mrs. josephine anenih speak, and being so inspired by her frank and strong feminism, which i had not expected at all.
surround chizalum too with a village of uncles. this will be harder, judging from the kind of friends chudi has. i still cannot get over that blustering man with the over-carved beard who kept saying at chudi’s last birthday party – “i have paid her bride price! a woman whose bride price i have paid cannot come and tell me nonsense!”
so please find the few good men that you can, the few non-blustering men. because the truth is that she will encounter a lot of male bluster in her life. so it is good to have alternatives from very early on.
i cannot overstate the power of alternatives. she can counter ideas about static ‘gender roles’ if she has been empowered by her familiarity with alternatives. if she knows an uncle who cooks well – and does so with indifference – then she can smile and brush off the foolishness of somebody who claims that ‘women must cook.’
teach her to question our culture’s selective use of biology as ‘reasons’ for social norms.
i know a yoruba woman, married to an igbo man, who was pregnant with her first child and was thinking of first names for the child. all the names were igbo.
shouldn’t they have yoruba first names since they would have their father’s igbo surname? i asked, and she said, ‘a child first belongs to the father. it has to be that way.’
we often use biology to explain the privileges that men have, the most common reason being men’s physical superiority. it is true that men are in general physically stronger than women. but our use of biology is selective. ‘a child first belongs to the father’ is a common sentiment in nigeria. but if we truly depended on biology as root of social norms then children would be identified as their mothers rather than their fathers because when a child is born, the parent we are biologically – and incontrovertibly – certain of is the mother. we assume the father is who the mother says the father is. how many lineages all over the world are not biological, i wonder?
for many igbo women, the conditioning is so complete that women think of children only as the father’s. i know of women who have left bad marriages but not been ‘allowed’ to take their children or even to see their children because the children belong to the man.
we also use evolutionary biology to explain male promiscuity, but not to explain female promiscuity, even though it really makes evolutionary sense for women to have many sexual partners – because the larger the genetic pool, the greater will be the chances of bearing offspring who will thrive.
so teach chizalum that biology is an interesting and fascinating subject, but she should never accept it as justification for any social norm. because social norms are created by human beings, and there is no social norm that cannot be changed.
talk to her about sex and start early. it will probably be a bit awkward but it is necessary.
remember that seminar we went to in class 3 where we were supposed to be taught about ‘sexuality’ but instead we listened to vague semi-threats about how ‘talking to boys’ would end up with us being pregnant and disgraced. i remember that hall and that seminar as a place filled with shame. ugly shame. that particular brand of shame that has to do with being female. may your daughter never encounter it.
with her, don’t pretend that sex is merely a controlled act of reproduction. or an ‘only in marriage’ act, because that is disingenuous. (you and chudi were having sex long before marriage and she will probably know this by the time she is twelve) tell her that sex can be a beautiful thing and that it can have emotional consequences and tell her to wait until she is an adult and tell her that once she is an adult, she gets to decide what she wants sex to mean to her. but be prepared because she might not wait until she’s 18. and if she doesn’t wait, you have to make sure she is able to tell you that.
it’s not enough to say you want to raise a daughter who can tell you anything, you have to give her the language to talk to you. and i mean this in a literal way. what should she call it? what word should she use?
i remember people used ‘ike’ when i was a child to mean both anus and vagina and anus was the easier meaning but it left everything vague and i never quite knew how to say that i, for example, had an itch in my vagina.
most childhood development experts and pediatricians say it is best to have children call sexual organs by their proper names – vagina and penis. i agree, but that is a decision you have to make. you should decide what name you want her to call it, but what matters is that there must be a name and that it cannot be a name that is weighed down with shame.
to make sure she doesn’t inherit shame from you, you have to free yourself of your own inherited shame. and i know how terribly difficult that is. in every culture in the world, female sexuality is about shame. even cultures – like many in the west – that expect women to be sexy still do not expect them to be sexual.
the shame we attach to female sexuality is about control. many cultures and religions control women’s bodies in one way or the other. if the justification for controlling women’s bodies were about women themselves, then it would be understandable. if, for example, the reason was – women should not wear short skirts because they can get cancer if they do. instead the reason is not about women, it is about men. women must be ‘covered up’ to protect men. i find this deeply dehumanizing because it reduces women to mere props used to manage the appetites of men.
and speaking of shame. never ever link sexuality and shame. or nakedness and shame. do not ever make ‘virginity’ a focus. every conversation about virginity becomes a conversation about shame. teach her to reject the linking of shame and female biology. why were we raised to speak in low tones about periods? to be filled with shame if our menstrual blood happened to stain our skirt? periods are nothing to be ashamed off. periods are normal and natural and the human species would not be here if periods did not exist. i remember a man who said a period was like shit. well, sacred shit, i told him, because you wouldn’t be here if periods didn’t happen.
romance will happen so be on board.
i’m writing this assuming she is heterosexual – she might not be, obviously. but i am assuming that because it is what i feel best equipped to talk about.
make sure you are aware of the romance in her life. and the only way you can do that is to start very early to give her the language with which to talk to you. i don’t mean you should be her ‘friend,’ i mean you should be her mother to whom she can talk about everything.
teach her that to love is not only to give but also to take. this is important because we give girls subtle cues about their lives – we teach girls that a large component of their ability to love is their ability to self-sacrifice. we do not teach this to boys. teach her that to love she must give of herself emotionally but she must also expect to be given.
i think love is the most important thing in life. whatever kind, however you define it but i think of it generally as being greatly valued by another human being and giving great value to another human being. but why do we raise only one half of the world to value this? i was recently in a roomful of young woman and was struck by how much of the conversation was about men – what terrible things men had done to them, this man cheated, this man lied, this man promised marriage and disappeared, this husband did this and that.
and i realized, sadly, that the reverse is not true. a roomful of men do not invariably end up talking about women – and if they do, it is more likely to be in objectifying flippant terms rather than as lamentations of life. why?
it goes back, i think, to that early conditioning. at a recent baby’s baptism ceremony, guests were asked to write their wishes for the baby girl. one guest wrote: i wish for you a good husband.’ well-intentioned obviously but very troubling. a three-month old baby girl already being told that a husband is something to aspire to. had the baby been a boy, it would not have occurred to that guest to wish him ‘ a good wife.’
and speaking of women lamenting about men who ‘promise’ marriage and then disappear. isn’t it odd that in most societies in the world today, women generally cannot propose marriage? marriage is such a major step in your life and yet you cannot take charge of it, it depends on a man asking you. so many women are in long term relationships and want to get married but have to ‘wait’ for the man to propose – and often this waiting becomes a performance, sometimes unconscious and sometimes not, of marriage-worthiness. if we apply the first feminism tool here, then it makes no sense that a woman who matters equally has to ‘wait’ for somebody else to initiate what will be a major life change for her.
a feminism lite adherent once told me that the fact that our society expects men to make proposals proved that women had the power, because only if a woman says yes can marriage happen. the truth is this – the real power resides in the person who asks. before you can say yes or no, you first must be asked. i truly wish for chizalum a world in which either person can propose, in which a relationship has become so comfortable, so joy-filled, that whether or not to embark on marriage becomes a conversation, itself filled with joy.
i want to say something about money here. teach her never ever to say such nonsense as ‘my money is my money and his money is our money.’ it is vile. and dangerous – to have that attitude means that you must potentially accept other harmful ideas as well. teach her that it is not a man’s role to provide. in a healthy relationship, it is the role of whoever can provide to provide.
in teaching her about oppression, be careful not to turn the oppressed into saints. saintliness is not a pre-requisite for dignity. people who are unkind and dishonest are still human, and still deserve dignity. property rights for rural nigerian women, for example, is a major feminist issue, and the women do not need to be good and angelic to be allowed their property rights.
there is sometimes, in the discourse around gender, the assumption that women are supposed to be morally ‘better’ than men. they are not. women are as human as men are. female goodness is as normal as female evil.
and there are many women in the world who do not like other women. female misogyny exists and to evade acknowledging it is to create unnecessary opportunities for anti-feminists to try and discredit feminism. i mean the sort of anti-feminists who will gleefully raise examples of women saying ‘i am not a feminist’ as though a person born with a vagina making this statement somehow automatically discredits feminism. that a woman claims not to be feminist does not diminish the necessity of feminism. if anything, it makes us see the extent of the problem, the successful reach of patriarchy. it shows us, too, that not all women are feminists and not all men are misogynists.
teach her about difference. make difference ordinary. make difference normal. teach her not to attach value to difference. and the reason for this is not to be fair or to be nice but merely to be human and practical. because difference is the reality of our world. and by teaching her about difference, you are equipping her to survive in a diverse world.
she must know and understand that people walk different paths in the world and that as long as those paths do no harm to others, they are valid paths that she must respect. teach her that we do not know – we cannot know – everything about life. both religion and science have spaces for the things we do not know, and it is enough to make peace with that.
teach her never to universalize her own standards or experiences. teach her that her standards are for her alone, and not for other people. this is the only necessary form of humility: the realization that difference is normal.
tell her that some people are gay, and some are not. a little child has two daddies or two mommies because some people just do. tell her that some people go to mosque and others go to church and others go to different places of worship and still others don’t worship at all, because that is just the way it is for some people.
you like palm oil but some people don’t like palm oil – you say to her.
why – she says to you.
i don’t know. it's just the way the world is – you say to her.
please note that i am not suggesting that you raise her to be ‘non judgmental’ which is a commonly used expression these days, and which slightly worries me. the general sentiment behind the idea is a fine one but ‘non-judgmental’ can easily devolve into meaning ‘don’t have an opinion about anything.’ and so, instead of that, what i hope for chizalum is this: that she will be full of opinions, and that her opinions will come from an informed, humane and broad-minded place.
may she be healthy and happy. may her life be whatever she wants it to be.
do you have a headache after reading all this? sorry. next time don’t ask me how to raise your daughter feminist.


femme sharks don’t eat our own.
femme sharks like to eat though
femme sharks recognize that femmes come in all kinds of sizes and each kind is luscious. we work towards loving our curvy, fat, skinny, supersize, thick, disabled, black and brown fine-ass bodies every day. we realize that loving ourselves in a racist/sexist/homo/transphobic/ablist/classist system is an every day act of war against that system.
femme sharks don’t think anorexia is cute.
we think eating a big-ass meal is sexy.
we say screw “height weight proportionate please” in craigslist women seeking women ads and in life.

we have big mouths and we know how to use
them. don’t fuck with us! ask us if we want to fuck though !

femme sharks will reclaim the power and dignity of femaleness by any means neccesary.
we’re girls blown up, turned inside out and remixed.

femme sharks are over white queers obliviousness to queer of color, two spirit and trans of color lives.
we know that we are a center of the universe
we’re over white femmes and butches who think that femme only comes in the color of barbie.
we’re over butches and boys and other femmes telling us what we need to do, wear or be in order to be “really femme.”

femme sharks recognize that femmes, butches, genderqueer and trans people
have been in communities of color since forever.
that before colonization we were seen as sacred
and we were some of the first folks most violently attacked
when our lands were invaded and colonized.
femme sharks won’t rest until we reclaim our positions
as beloved family within our communities.

femme sharks aren’t just dimepieces and trophy wives
fuck that!

"no," i shouted. "i won't marry you. i won't do it. no one can force me!" i swallowed and wiped my mouth on my filthy sleeve. i leaped up, ready to defy anyone.

"who would force you?"

"no matter who. i won't, i won't. they can't make me, no one can make me. i won't marry you."

"i won't! stop ordering me to!" i was still shouting, invigorated. i wanted to march, waving banners.

we are not supposed to question systems or institutions themselves. there’s this notion that we have to only seek justice, safety and equal pay through the one venue they allow, which is the male-dominated corporate world.
there’s been a massive popularization and corporatization of feminism, of anti-sexual assault activism, and of the gender gap/wage inequality movement. so what people start doing is saying, “let’s push for legislation, let’s donate to a big charity, let’s vote this person in for president.” as someone who worked in non-profits and governmental positions, i know there are so many limitations when we’re looking at these institutions as the solution providers. so much of that money does not go to direct services. it does not go directly to helping women who need it the most. there are so many barriers and stipulations with money. #giveyourmoneytowomen says we need to directly shift that money. this needs to go to paypals, square cash accounts, direct deposits, or in the form of stacks of dollars from atm withdrawals. we cannot go through or expect institutions to solve these immediate and structural problems.
it’s also infantilizing – the premise behind giving money to these institutions is that if they hand women the money directly, women won’t know what to do with it. so, it’s better off if they take these indirect routes, where if you follow the rules maybe you’ll finally get access to something that can help you. but it’s just another way that they keep the women from accessing capital. meanwhile, the expectation is that we should shrink and continue to suffer because many institutions don’t truly see how women are affected by systems that require their lives, but not their safety. they need more research, they’re not doing the research, they aren’t looking, they aren’t paying attention. how long are should we wait? i’m not waiting anymore. i have a life to live.
i realized i was depleting myself dealing with men both at work and otherwise. my career trajectory has almost always depended on male-dominated work, where i was constantly subject to unwanted male gaze and male emotion. it’s demoralizing and exhausting, and it’s the perfect catalyst for mental health problems, which then can jeopardize employment altogether. and not only are women’s wages incommensurate with our job descriptions in any given male-dominated field, but we receive no compensation for any of the other bullshit that is automatically attached to the job simply because we are women. i’ve never gotten paid to get ogled and flirted with every single day in the office. nothing about that is sustainable as an avenue for survival, let alone achievement of financial security.
i noticed a similar pattern in my personal life, where men who alleged make my life better than before, consistently made it worse. continuing to invest myself into relationships on the off-chance men would one day start carrying their own weight, became unrealistic and difficult to justify. and so this has been hugely life-changing for me in that i’m no longer beholden to anyone who does not directly and immediately support my success and well-being, and i can be compensated for any and all time and energy asked of me, on my own terms.
for me, this really started when my business and my relationship life had produced a death spiral in that very special way when you find yourself with any visibility. i wanted privacy and income. i started to think about what i could immediately capitalize. so i built up a net of sites and i spent so much time in that world everyday. i was watching the industry and its intersections; relating it to my experiences and to civilian dynamics as well. my interactions through the development of the network matured my perspective on power dynamics. i started off just wanting to make money for myself because that was the most pressing need, and then i started to put together how my work related to women at large…and particularly women under capitalism. the dynamics apply to and affect women, as opposed to just dominatrixes or escorts or any type of job description that women are typically given when they directly capitalize on male interest in female attention, energy, sex, etc.
this came in the days following anger at the “wife bonus,” and we just started talking about all types of uncompensated labors, in the form of sexual labor, emotional labor, physical labor, educational labor [particularly what we’ve provided in a number of ways digitally], all of this is without monetary return.
 so it seems that when we start to talk about giving money to women and wealth exchange and essentially monetizing things like women’s time, attention, access to them, the emotional labor that they do, giving them recompense for violence and inequality, people get really upset.
i think what is happening is that the mainstream feminist movement for its existence has decidedly said that what’s really feminist is having your own job and having your own money and making your own money, not “relying” on men, not being a stay-at-home partner, being independent. but all of this is meant a very specific context — corporate

yes, “break the glass ceiling” and reach the top. and actually subsume yourself more into patriarchy, more into these institutions, mimic the systems that have created the disaster world we live in, and that’s how we’re supposedly going to get free. as bardot has mentioned this isn’t about us needing to be paid more in the patriarchal-dominated wage system, or  “wanting cash for nothing”, it’s about not being paid for what is wanted and desired from us, and now monetizing that.

so anything outside that is considered a failure. they need to find a reason to make what you’re doing unacceptable so they can diminish your success. they’re trying to essentially withhold approval of your existence. everyone knows women are used to sell things all the time, our sexuality is used to sell things to other people and make money for other people all the time. there’s no way out of this because you can’t strip your sexuality away from you.

sexuality is how women are policed. it operates on vanilla women, with civilian women, with women who don’t even know sex work exists. it’s how men navigate relating to us in public and private spaces, and how much of that is degrading, violent, passive aggressive, aggressive aggressive, etc. it takes a toll on every woman alive in some way.
it also creates a double bind where fulfilling either destiny becomes a way to trap and punish you. if you’re a “good” woman and you serve men submissively and without question, you are vulnerable to whatever comes to you. sure some women luck out with kind men, we know many do not. we see it everywhere. we do not live in that shared upper class delusion. we can’t afford that denial.
if you decide that it’s not worth it to play the game, you become a “bad” woman. a whore. a slut. a bitch. now you’re a target for abuse. you stepped outside of the “safe” zone they’ve allowed you so they feel entitled to abuse you freely. “she was asking for it.”  how convenient. they will find endless reasons to justify who deserves to be violated. so the way out of this trap is not to fight them, but to turn their weapons on them.
sexuality becomes her weapon again.
i was working in tech and finance and both of those environments, they are using your sexuality against you. the more visible you are, the harder you have to be to persist against the result of the visibility. in places where you are the only woman, this makes you a target. you can’t opt out of how *they* assess your sexuality. it was actually more unpleasant for me to be in an environment where i’m subject to the sheathed psychological dominations of men who don’t like how smart i am or how fast i rose their ranks very early in my career. i’d rather deal with them on my own terms. they certainly haven’t stopped coming to me.

i’m finding there are levels of disapproval on a spectrum of socially accepted financial exchange. people get stuck on what they already deem worthy of payment. some will say it’s okay to receive gifts and shopping money from a suitor, but what bardot and i are doing is dirty and immoral. once they have these preconceived delineations of acceptable financial exchange, wherever on the spectrum that may be, they find anything outside of that unacceptable. even people who themselves face violent stigma and devaluation for their own work have also lashed out against the concept, claiming what they do for a living is legitimate because it has a job title, whereas providing emotional labor is illegitimate and unworthy of compensation because it doesn’t have a job title. so, whatever they get paid to do is valuable, but what others do, isn’t, and they’re somehow authorized to assert this distinction? why? because of semantics?
and ironically, many of the individuals who have reacted this way also vociferously object to the safety risks and economic violence they face, that stem from the exact brand of capitalistic gatekeeping they themselves are now enacting. this hypocrisy specifically targets women of color–particularly black women–who are already largely denied participation in any kind of socially sanctioned paid labor. much work that is financially compensated today has also undergone similar scrutiny and denial of recognition — child care, mental health care, and housekeeping service, and more.
and of course, the response from men has been predictably polarized. many men paid women right away. in some cases, not knowing how to repay us for their consumption of our time, energy, and intellectual labor, had been a source of guilt; so this type of exchange presented them with an opportunity to finally balance the scales and affect some welcome relief from the burden of indebtedness. and then there was the onslaught of male rage. the prevailing sentiment seems premised on a misconception: many men declare women do not deserve money for no reason. to that, i would say i agree: we only require recompense for any and all benefits they reap from women, including taking up our time and energy for any and all reasons. if they seek nothing, then there is nothing to discuss. and that should also mean they never interact with or go near any woman, ever again. which is perfectly fine with me. so, why such rage, then?

specifically, there’s a large overlap, it’s privileged women, because these women don’t understand that not everyone has security other than what they provide for themselves. it’s women who have never had a threat to their existence, and basically its this huge overlap with sheltered white women. they are really pissed off that anyone who doesn’t look or live like them, be it person of color, queer person, sex worker, whatever, anyone who doesn’t exist as they do could possibly have any kind of security and access to capital that they do…nevermind how *they* got it.
and because people are conditioned that the “demand” is coming from a certain type of person, they decide it’s not actually worth money. this goes back to classism again and again and again. if you look across the spectrum, things women do for society are valued little or not at all in terms of money. they’re essentially forced to access capital through their relationships with men: personal, familial, professional. so we’re dealing with who has a right to access the means to provide a security and that’s a really fucked up position.

a big theme of #giveyourmoneytowomen definitely seems to be around how much money is being made off women by male-dominated institutions and corporate environments, and that money not actually resulting in capital and wealth for women.

if you look at the sex industry, you can’t even come up with a figure because there’s no way to measure how many things are just never capitalized in our interest. if you think about the way the mainstream porn industry works, most women are paid as laborers and kind of discarded, and every cent of profit and capital that comes out of those videos then goes back to these companies. so if you wanted to calculate it as a percentage of the amount of money that’s currently being spent on this type of work and this type of output, i would say upwards of 75% of it is being missed by the women that create it.
so there’s a chasm between women being able to do that on on their own and directly, which is something that the internet — theoretically — provides for anyone who can build a supportive patronage for themselves and/or their digital wares. we see a very diverse but contained application of this in the sex industry. you have women catering to all sorts of niches and building their own sites to be able to do this, but much of the existing technical and financial infrastructure is run, financed, and regulated by exploitive entities.
the internet is 30% adult traffic. so i keep seeing this pattern of women and their sexuality being used against us, and being something to be consumed and depleted. that makes me want to find ways to get direct compensation back to the source of that energy.

 speaking of the internet, think about the way even mainstream social media platforms like facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram, and others, capitalize on female participation. on facebook, people who click on profiles are mostly men, and people whose profiles are clicked on are mostly women. so my having a personal account on facebook makes me a product for facebook to sell to men. and now that site is worth $250 billion. likewise, nightlife venues thrive by getting women to participate in their business operations, and they do so by waiving or discounting cover charges or otherwise marketing to women specifically. women are the product these establishments are selling to men, who then arrive and spend heavily just to be in the same room as women. but i’ve never received a check from facebook or any club for my business development services. so, instead of wasting my time generating revenue for corporate entities that aren’t paying me, i’d rather make my social interactions profitable to me.

and since this is all happening on mainstream platforms, we’re seeing broadly that men are just approaching women online at all times for all reasons, expecting to be accommodated or humored or entertained or fought with or whatever it is. it’s not trivial. and it’s not without cost. so i started just using that as my own practice: my boundary is that if you want to talk to to me at all, you have to pay. period.

i started actively using twitter about two years ago and soon discovered how taxing and violent the daily online experience was. it’s particularly unmanageable if you don’t enforce a highly selective filtering mechanism, so i eventually followed bardot’s example and began requiring payment to interact with me.

some women have been swift to recognize that their own consumption also comes at a direct cost to other women. a handful of women, mostly white women, have sent me money, expressing gratitude for knowledge and insights i’ve shared that have impacted their lives. a select few white women have acknowledged their status as beneficiaries of my intellectual labor specifically resulting from racialized marginalization at the hands of white women. so they paid. it’s an important and significant gesture. this is capitalism: words and white guilt don’t improve my life, but capital does.
there are also women paying me to work with them privately. it’s an opportunity for those who have wanted my expertise, counsel, time, and energy, but held back knowing it was wrong to ask me for it without somehow replenishing their consumption. this paradigm opens up avenues for everyone, not just men, to get their needs met systematically and fairly, which provides potential for our human relationships to be more equitable and sustainable than ever.

white women are the biggest beneficiaries of white men’s historical wealth. when we begin to really dissect what pay inequality means we have to look at it intersectionally. when thinking about wealth redistribution it’s important for white women to look at their position to women of color, and examine how for generations they have also exploited us and gained huge advantages off us. recently even the *anti-establishment* champion of the 2016 presidential race said that we should put race and gender aside in our strategy to fix economic problems. we need to be centering race and gender in this discussion.

another major component to this movement is the discussion about gender-based violence and #giveyourmoneytowomen as playing a role in that violence. even when we’re talking about just like, what a woman’s experiences of violence over her life is, what is the financial cost of that

it’s high. high. violence is expensive, and for years now, i have been advocating monetary compensation as an alternative to the justice system and prison industrial complex, and that retribution for domestic violence and sexual assault needs to come in straight cash. some of my first activism and feminist work around violence started in college, with regard to campus sexual assault. many women pay a year’s tuition or even four years tuition, or the amount of an entire four-year degree [or more] that they have to forfeit and drop out of because of experiencing violence. and if we look at how many women are sexually assaulted, stalked, harassed, beat up or abused in any kind of way by men across the board, and what the opportunity cost and capital cost and monetary cost of that sabotage – that’s trillions of dollars. additionally what losing a degree – especially an advanced one – can mean in the long run: a job and desired salary and potential to have more economic security in the course of your life; that could all be gone.
and throughout the course of a lifetime of having to leave violent situations, that requires transportation, having a car maybe or gas money or being able to access public transportation or having someone to pick you up. finding another location that is safe either permanently or temporarily, but that being available for you. if you have kids, this multiplies…. exponentially. you might have to even quit your job in terms of whatever relationship you were in, especially if it’s also your workplace environment that’s hostile. having your work sabotaged, having your finances sabotaged/being controlled financially, monitored and surveilled with things you can spend money on or having it restricted from you. maybe even having zero dollars to your name for a very long time because of all of this and your ability to survive is obliterated.

when you’re escaping a dangerous situation in a hurry, sometimes you have to leave with nothing in hand. how many of us have the luxury of a separate savings account just in case we suddenly have to run away and start our lives over from scratch, particularly if we have children? it’s especially difficult to prepare oneself when abusive partners often control household finances from the outset, expressly to preclude victims from ever exiting a violent situation.

we use money as our way to exchange value, to secure resources. so since men are the primary controllers of money, women are conditioned to want access to men because that’s essentially an access point to security. our cultural expectation of sexual monogamy in exchange for any provision of resources between a man and a woman often puts women in the position where they are dependent on one person. it is the same dynamic that casts all other behavior into whoredom.
women, like all living beings, seek resources for themselves. we’ve decided some ways are ok for them to do this, some are not. we punish anyone who steps outside those bounds.

another important thing that’s been brought up in terms of this conversation is the sheer number of women that experience absolutely horrific abuse, and they get absolutely nothing.

 i would say i fall into that category, my experience in business has been so violent that i left it to start my own consultancy after only a few short years. i cannot even imagine going back into that type of environment; there’s hardly upside. and i think women who are not willing to tolerate that get additional abuse. essentially in speaking up about it, they want to determine if you’re worthy of having objections, whether you’re worthy of disturbing the male dominated-environment. they want to make it so there’s something wrong with you and the system’s completely fine. you have to just turn away, you have to just walk.

i also want to mention this in terms of anti-violence, because we’ve all talked about this individually as a violence prevention strategy. there are few things that men love more than their money. if they are making an investment up front and in advance to be able to have access, the chances they are going to harm or disrupt or destroy their investment shrink.

it’s a litmus test of their intentions, upfront and in substantive terms. in a capitalistic society, money secures power and safety. statistically, women engaging with men in any capacity is an unsafe venture. if a man wants me to open myself to risk so he can consume my time and energy, but he is unwilling to offset that risk in substantive terms? without question he is a liability. next. and while there’s no guarantee a man who pays won’t be violent in some way, it does eliminate men who are certain deadweight.

in my mind, allowing women to see that they have power, and that they can wield it for themselves. there is nothing more rational than capitalizing on what the world asks of you.

for me the goal is a drastic cultural shift, to where what we’re doing is normalized, so that all of women’s contributions command direct access to resources and without question. this is how things always should’ve been.

having a whole new theory of economics. thinking about this on basic, anatomical, and also a global scale. both micro and macro levels: violence reduction, rebalancing the positionality of income, slowing down unrelenting capitalism, reparations for certain populations of women, and tangibly improving lives and safety.
